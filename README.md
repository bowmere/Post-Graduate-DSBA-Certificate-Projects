E-News Express Project Description:
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.
INN Hotels Project Description:
Built and compared Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to best compute predictions of the INN Hotel dataset. Applied principles of multicollinearity and AUC-ROC curves to create logistic regression models; applied pre/post-pruning methods to create Decision Tree models. Final models were compared using f1_Scores to best help INN Hotels predict booking statuses in advance. Using statistical analysis and features of importance, INN Hotels would need applicable business policies to reduce cancellations with respect to: high lead time, online purchases, special requests, and average room price. The company was recommended to create a loyalty program that allowed repeating customers to ‘unlock’ extended lead time; INN Hotels was also informed of how their online market needed to improve booking confirmations and market special features to limit cancellations.
